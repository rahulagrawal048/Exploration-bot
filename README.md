A bot that autonomously explores a maze using SLAM and A* path planning. The bot uses frontiers to explore the maze and map the environment using LIDAR. After the exploration is completed, it uses A* to make the path back to its home position. The figure shows the path planned by A* in green and the pose tracked by SLAM in blue.
